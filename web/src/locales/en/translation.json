  "about-container.description-a": "It all started back in 2019, when I followed my curiosity about computers. My original plan was to dive into cybersecurity — it seemed like the perfect fit. But then I hit a requirement: I had to learn how to code. That’s when I discovered an entirely new world — the logic, the creativity, and the thrill of bringing an idea to life on the screen.",
  "about-container.description-b": "What started as a requirement quickly became a passion. Since then, I haven’t looked back. I studied, experimented, ran into roadblocks, and built projects that took me down amazing paths: web development, automation, desktop and mobile apps... Today, I bring experience with many languages, frameworks, and tools — and an ever-growing drive to create powerful solutions. Coffee helps, sure — but what really fuels me is the passion for building things that work. If you also believe great ideas deserve great execution, we’ve already got something in common!",
